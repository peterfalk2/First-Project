                I like cake. I like cake so much that I didn't want to insert "lorem ipsum" here. Not that I have anything much to say about cake. Except that it's delicious. But you already knew that! So I could blather on about the virtues of flour, eggs, butter, spices, flavourings and sugar but what's the point? The point really is just to fill in some text space here. However, I seem to have run out of things to write about already. That's not surprising. I don't enjoy <em>writing</em> about cake. I enjoy <em>eating</em> cake!
